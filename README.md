Big Data-Powered Temperature Prediction Using PySpark and Time Series Machine Learning Techniques

I have developed predictive models using ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost, and Linear Regression for global temperature analysis.

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R², demonstrating actionable insights.

Research Process Steps :

1. Data Acquisition: Weather Data was acquired from Kaggle.
2. Feature Selection: I identified relevant features based on their correlation with the global temperature patterns derived from the insights in the literature.
3. Model Training: Several ARIMA, SARIMA, XGBoost and Linear Regression models were attempted with the dataset and trained, fitting the hyperparameters using grid search techniques.
4. Model Validation: An 80-20 train-test split was used for validating the models and the corresponding performance of the models were evaluated using RMSE, MSE and R² scores.
5. Analysis and Comparison: I critically analyzed results and compared each model's predictive performance in the context of existing literature.
6. Visualization: Interactive dashboards were generated using Power BI to visualize model predictions, seasonal trends and model comparison, to further comprehend temperature dynamics.
